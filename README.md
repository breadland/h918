**ROMs, Recoveries and Tools for the LG V20 T-Mobile Variant (H918)**

So far I'll only be hosting some of the more difficult to find ROMs and recoveries.
Will link to the rest.
 
*** **ROMs** ***

Rehosted thanks to FeNo2 from XDA willing to upload their backup. It's a stock Oreo ROM that can be flashed through TWRP and won't relock your bootloader.

Was only available through telegram iirc, can't find it on XDA. Only for the stock Oreo ROM by the way.
