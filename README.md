ROMs, Recoveries and Tools for the LG V20 T-Mobile Variant (H918)

So far I'll only be hosting some of the more difficult to find ROMs and recoveries.
Will link to the rest.

**ROMs**

Rehosted thanks to FeNo2 from XDA willing to upload their backup. It's a stock Oreo ROM that can be flashed through TWRP and won't relock your bootloader.


**Recoveries**

[H918_V2.3-BETA1-mk2000](https://github.com/breadland/h918/releases/download/Recoveries/H918_v2.3-BETA1-mk2000.zip)
Was only available through telegram iirc, can't find it on XDA. Only for the stock Oreo ROM by the way.



[H198_v2.2-PHXCLANG2-rebuild-mk2000](https://github.com/breadland/h918/releases/download/Recoveries/H918_v2.2-PHXCLANG2-rebuild-mk2000.zip)
Only for the stock Oreo ROM.
